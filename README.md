# Simple js pong game
This is my first project in JavaScript, a language which I have no previous experience in.

The game resembles the classic Pong, however the scoring is a bit different. Player gets one point for every hit. To make it more interesting, the amount of balls increases every time the AI misses. The game ends when the player has missed every ball on game.
